2. Fetch Wallet Addresses from User Names:

3. Check User Activity:

4. Main Web Interface Endpoint:

Please note that these endpoints are just placeholders and should be implemented on your backend server. You'll need to handle the actual data processing and interactions with external APIs within these endpoints. Additionally, make sure to implement proper authentication, rate limiting, and error handling to ensure the security and reliability of your application.

Please note that these snippets assume you've already set up the necessary functions (fetchTwitterPosts, fetchWalletAddressesFromUserNames, checkUserActivity) as discussed in the previous responses. Additionally, you'll need to set up your server using a framework like Express.js, handle CORS, and ensure proper error handling and security measures.

Also, replace the placeholders (YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY, etc.) with your actual API keys and details.
